    You can fool your buddies. Just don't fool yourself. Dude, it doesn't matter
    if you lied to him. Just get over it. But I hope you wipe the corners of
    your eyes after this paragraph, and don't let the tears fall on the phone
    screen. It's okay to believe everything you say, man. Can also let you have
    a heart comfort, but this kind of words out to deceive the brothers almost
    got, the brothers believe you will not lose a piece of meat, but you don't
    make yourself seriously on the line. It really doesn't matter if a brother
    is fooled by you, a brother will smile and pass. Really not brothers want to
    break your guard, you wipe your tears and think about it, but brothers who
    will believe you?易哲
